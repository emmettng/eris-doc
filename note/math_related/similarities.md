#  Metric functions / Similarities
Functions in this module are being used to:

    1. Compute similarity between vectors.
    2. All vectors contain positive number only.

Given **$n$** dimensional vectors **$X$** and **$Y$** , this module contains functions of following definitions:

### 1. **$L_p$-norm** based 
> - **$L_1$- norm** based
> $$ \sum_i |(x_i-y_i)|$$
> - **Sum Absolute Differece(SAD)** of  $X$ and $Y$.  
> - **Manhattan Distance**     of  $X$ and $Y$.  
> - **Taxicab metric** of          $X$ and $Y$.  
> - **$L_1$-norm** of $X-Y$ . 
>> - **Mean Absolute Difference(MAD)** of $X$ and $Y$  
>> is above definition averaged by the vector dimension **n**.  
>> $$ \frac{\sum_i|(x_i - y_i)|}{n}$$
>
>> -  
>> $$d_{CAD}:(x,y) \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|x_i-y_i|}{|x_i|+|y_i|}$$
>> - **Canberra Distance**
>> The Canberra distance is a weighted version of the Manhattan distance (**l1-norm**).

> - **$L_2$-norm** based
> $$\sqrt{\sum_i(x_i-y_i)^2}$$
> - **Euclidean Diststance**  of $X$ and $Y$  
> - **$L_2$-norm** of $X-Y$  
>> - **Sum Squred Difference (SSD)** of $X$ and $Y$
>> - **Squared $L_2$- norm**
>> $$ \sum_i(x_i-y_i)^2 = (X-Y) \cdot (X-Y) $$
>
>> - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** of $X$ and $Y$  
>> is above definition averaged by vector dimension **n**.  
>>  $$ \frac{\sum_i(x_i-y_i)^2}{n} = \frac{(X -Y) \cdot (X-Y)}{n}$$


>- **$L_{\_p}$-norm** based
> $$d_p:(x,y) \mapsto ||x_i - y_i||_p = (\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i-y_i|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}$$
> **Minkowski Distance**   
> The Minkowski distance is the generalized $L_p$-norm of the difference.

>> .When $p$ approaches `infinity`, we get:
>> - **Chebyshev Distance**
>> - **Chess board distance**
>> $$d_\infty:(x,y) \mapsto ||x_i - y_i||_\infty = \lim_{p \rightarrow \infty}(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i-y_i|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}} = \max_i|x_i-y_i|$$
>> Distance between two vectors is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension.

>> . When $p$ is `0`, we get:
>> - **Hanmming Distance**   
>> Hamming Distance is minkowskiDistance with p=0.
>> $$d_0:(x,y)\mapsto||x_i-y_i||_0=\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i-y_i|^0$$
>> Between two equal length of same type vectors(instance of Eq), it is the **number** of positions at which corresponding elements are **different**.

>> - Being **Loss/Risk function**   
>> As described in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function), risk function is the expect value of corresponding loss function.
>> $$R(\theta,\delta) = E_\theta L(\theta,\delta(X))$$
>> In `regression problem`, most lost functions heavily rely on **$L_1$-norm** or  **$L_2$-norm**.

>>> 1. Uniqueness  
>>> Assume the truth of $n$ time observation is vector: $Y = (y_1,y_2,...,y_n)$
>>> The output of our hypothesis is: $H=(h_1,h_2,...,h_n)$.  
>>> **$L_1$-norm** basd loss function relay on fumular : 
>>> $$\sum_i|y_i-h_i| = (|y_1-h_1| +|y_2-h_2|+...+ |y_i-h_i|)$$
>>> The sum of two functions $f_1(h)= |y_1-h|$ and $f_2(h)= |y_2-h|$ will be a constant number in range $h\in[y_1,y_2]$ and the proof is trivial. The absolute value of the derivative of these two function are constant number '1' and in range $h\in[y_1,y_2]$ their derivative has different direction so, the sum of these two function is guaranteed to be a stable number and this number is the minimal value of the sum of these two functions $f_1(h)+f_2(h)$. 
>>>
>>> The blue line is : $f(h) = |2-x|$, the yellow is $f(h) = |8-x|$, the red is the sum.
>>>![l1_uniquess_no](/imgs/l1_loss_unique.png)
>>> According to [Central_tendency#uniqueness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency#Uniqueness).    
>>> - Several measures of central tendency can be characterized as solving a variational problem, in the sense of the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations), namely minimizing variation from the center. That is, given a measure of statistical dispersion, one asks for a measure of central tendency that minimizes variation: such that variation from the center is minimal among all choices of center. In a quip, "dispersion precedes location". This center may or may not be unique. In the sense of Lp spaces, the correspondence is:
>>>
>>>  |Lp|	dispersion|	central tendency|
>>>  |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
>>>  |L0	|variation ratio	            |mode
>>>  |L1	|average   absolute deviation|	median
>>>  |L1	|average   absolute deviation|	geometric median
>>>  |L2	|standard  deviation	        |mean
>>>  |Lâˆž	|maximum   deviation	        |midrange
>>>
>>> In a real-world machine learning scenario, the situation is usually that we will get different results with same input (`This is why we need machine learning`), therefore, as demostrated in the image above, when there are even number of elements included in the $L_1$-norm based loss function, the result will be ambiguous.
>>
>>> The first derivate of **$L_2$-norm** based loss function is $x$, it is possible to find, but there is only one minimual value of the sum of these functions.
>>>![l2_uniquess_yes](/imgs/l2_loss_unique.png)
>>> From vector transformation point of view from:
>>> $$J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}(y-\theta X^T)\cdot(y - \theta X^T)^T+\alpha\theta \theta^T$$
>>> $$\theta = yX(X^TX+\alpha I)^{-1}$$

>>> 2. `Robust`   
>>> The robust property referse to tolerant variance of lablel `'Y'`.    
>>> Usually, $y$ outlier can have less influence on $L_1$ loss function than $L_2$ loss functions. 
>>> 3. `Stability`    
>>> The Stability property referse to tolerant variance of input `'X'`.    
>>> $x$ outliers could have great influence on both types of loss function and lead to different optimization hypothesis gramatically.

Actually, all these method scaled featured somehow, cause they eventually need to do comparesion (compare targe and training hypothesis to get training error) just some algorithms could do normalization implicitly, others cannot.
