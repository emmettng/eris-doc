## 1.Hspec
Hspec name is `Model+Spec.hs`

## 2.Quickcheck    
Quickcheck stack project note:
- exmaples in folder `tests/Quicknote`, the same as `source-dirs` in package.yaml
- main model in file `Examples.hs`, the same as `main` in package.yaml
- The model name of file `Examples.hs` must be `Main` rather than `Example` or `Quicknote.Example`.
  - The model name of file which is desgnated in `main` field in the package.yaml must be `Main`.
  - If there is more than one file in `tests/Quicknote` there mode name is the form `Quicknote.xxxx`.

```
Similarity
  L1-norm based. Property tests:

```

```
 quickCheck :: quickCheck :: Testable prop => prop -> IO ()
```

```
quickCheckWith :: quickCheckWith :: Testable prop => Args -> prop -> IO ()
```

```
verboseCheck :: Testable prop => prop -> IO ()
```

#### 2.1 Sample reminder
```
import Test.QuickCheck 

prop_rev :: [a] -> Bool
prop_rev xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs

main = quickCheck prop_RevRev
```
The target function we would like to test is `reverse`.   
The property of this target function is: If we apply this function twice `reverse (reverse xs)`, we will get the original list `xs`.  
This proporty is being described as `reverse (reverse xs) == xs`  

QuickCheck generates number of random values of type `a` and feed to function `prop_rev`.   

The most commonly being used function is of type:
```
auxiFunc :: a -> Bool
```
This function is an instance of TypeClass `Testable`.

TODO 
with necessary chart    
condition, generator, sized etc...

## 3. Note
>  
> - **Properties**  
> `Polymorphic` properties, such as the function `prop_rev` in simple remind, must be restricted to a particular type to be used for testing. Otherwise, there will be no clue for QuickCheck to generate test values.

> - `fa :: [a] -> Bool` : A filter function, discards auto generated test cases which do not satisfy the condition, Test case generation continues until 100 cases which do satisfy the condition have been found, or until an overall limit on the number of test cases is reached (to avoid looping if the condition never holds).

>Quantified Properties. The first argument of `forAll` is a test data generator; by supplying a custom generator, instead of using the default generator for that type, it is possible to control the **distribution** of test data. 


> **Observing Test Case Distribution**
> It is important to be aware of the distribution of test cases: if test data is not well distributed then conclusions drawn from the test results may be invalid. In particular, the ==> operator can skew the distribution of test data badly, since only test data which satisfies the given condition is used.

> Test Data Generators: The Type Gen  
> Test data is produced by test data generators. QuickCheck defines default generators for most types, but you can use your own with forAll, and will need to define your own generators for any new types you introduce.
> Generators have types of the form Gen a; this is a generator for values of type a. The type Gen is a monad, so Haskell's do-syntax and standard monadic functions can be used to define generators.

>> - **Generating Recursive Data Types**
>> Generators for recursive data types are easy to express using oneof or frequency to choose between constructors, and Haskell's standard monadic combinators to form a generator for each case. For example, if the type of trees is defined by. For example:
>> ```
>> prime
>> ```
>> However, there is always a risk that a recursive generator like this may fail to terminate, or produce very large results. To avoid this, recursive generators should always use the **size control mechanism**. For example:
>> ```
>> Tree example
>> ```




> - **sized**
> Test data generators have an implicit size parameter; quickCheck begins by generating small test cases, and gradually increases the size as testing progresses. Different test data generators interpret the size parameter in different ways: some ignore it, while the list generator, for example, interprets it as an upper bound on the length of generated lists. You are free to use it as you wish to control your own test data generators.

>- **Tip: Using newtype**
>want a different distribution
>Of course, you can write a custom test data generator for variable names, maybe choosing randomly from a small set, and try to remember to use it wherever a string plays the role of a name. But this is error prone. Much better is to define a new type of names, isomorphic to String, and make your custom generator the default for it. For example,
>
>newtype Name = Name String
>
>instance Arbitrary Name where
>  `arbitrary = oneof ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]`
